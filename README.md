This project focuses on enhancing medication safety to prevent accidental intake, particularly for vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. These groups often face challenges in understanding the medications they are prescribed, whether due to complex instructions, insufficient information, or lack of personalized care. In care facilities, elderly and disabled individuals are at higher risk of medication errors, as they may rely heavily on caregivers who sometimes have limited time for personalized attention.

Through this project, we aim to use innovative tools and streamlined processes to ensure medications are administered correctly, reducing the risk of accidental overdose or improper use. Weâ€™re also mindful of teenagers and young adults who may encounter risks related to misunderstanding or misusing medications. By focusing on accurate, accessible information and improved safety protocols, our goal is to create a safer and more informed environment around medication use for all.
